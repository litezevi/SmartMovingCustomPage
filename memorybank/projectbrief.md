# SmartMoving Custom Page Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on redesigning the customer portal page for 617 Boston Movers, a moving company using the SmartMoving platform. The goal is to create a unique, branded experience that distinguishes them from other companies using the same platform.

## Current State
- Single page application with limited CSS customization access
- Working with SmartMoving's customer portal system
- Only CSS modifications are allowed (no HTML/JS changes)
- Base HTML structure is fixed and provided by the platform

## Key Constraints
- **CSS-only customization**: Can only modify styles through custom CSS field
- **Platform limitations**: Cannot modify HTML structure or add JavaScript
- **Brand consistency**: Must maintain 617 Boston Movers brand identity
- **Responsive design**: Must work across all device sizes

## Success Criteria
- Page looks distinctly different from standard SmartMoving pages
- Maintains all functional elements while improving aesthetics
- Follows brand guidelines and color scheme
- Professional, modern appearance that builds customer trust

## Target Audience
- Customers who have received moving estimates from 617 Boston Movers
- Users need to understand pricing, schedule, and service details
- Mobile and desktop users requiring clear, accessible information
