# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
617 Boston Movers uses the SmartMoving platform for their customer portal, but the default appearance looks generic and identical to other moving companies. This creates a poor brand experience and doesn't reflect the company's premium positioning.

## Problems Being Solved
1. **Brand Dilution**: Current page looks identical to competitors using the same platform
2. **Poor User Experience**: Generic design doesn't build trust or convey professionalism
3. **Missed Brand Opportunity**: No visual differentiation in customer touchpoint
4. **Competitive Disadvantage**: Cannot stand out in a crowded market

## How It Should Work
The custom CSS should transform the standard SmartMoving interface into a uniquely branded experience that:
- Immediately communicates 617 Boston Movers brand identity
- Enhances readability and visual hierarchy
- Creates a premium, trustworthy appearance
- Maintains all functionality while improving aesthetics

## User Experience Goals
- **Instant Recognition**: Users immediately know they're on 617 Boston Movers' page
- **Enhanced Trust**: Professional design builds confidence in the service
- **Improved Clarity**: Better visual hierarchy makes important information easier to find
- **Mobile Excellence**: Seamless experience across all devices
- **Brand Consistency**: Aligns with company's premium positioning
